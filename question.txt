PART 1:
Consider following text:
Welcome to Dungeon!
Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
within.
In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
Create a command-line executable program that takes the above on standard 
input and outputs word frequency counts. For example, if the input stream was 
“Mary Had a Little Lamb!” then the output for this program would be:
a 1
had 1
lamb 1
little 1
mary 1


PART 2: (OPTIONAL BONUS)
In addition to the word frequency counts, compute the s for the counts and 
output it as the last line.
